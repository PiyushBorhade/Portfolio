		<p>This is PIYUSH BORHADE. My true love for Computer Science and its facinating aspects grew when I was in 9,this was the time when we had started learning the basics of computer science.I completed my 10 from Kukadi Valley Public School(CBSE) with 10 GCPA score.It was then, I decided to take Science stream and wanted to get more knowledge about IT and its relating topic.
		<br><br>
		I specifically enjoyed studying RDBMS,Algorithm,C++,JAVA,PHP probably Maths had always been my favourite.In the last year we had completed our academic project,We had made two projects,first regarding Gym Management System: Storing information of members according to their id,to provide correct,complete,secure data,to develop a well- organized information storage system and second was of Computer Graphics.
		<br><br>
		I learnt working of back-end,front-end and I have completed project ragarding PGLife.I was also enrolled in co-scholastic efforts and co-curricular activities. Even though my main focus was academics, I believe in having proper participation in extracurricular activities and making co-scholastic efforts to improve interaction in the co-working space and corporate world.I was awarded as Best Candidate of 2019(NSS) and also I was a part of World Guniess Record which was organised by National Service Scheme(NSS).
